***PART1***

For part 1 my executable is named 'exec'

Compiled with just 'make'

My program gives a choice of what to measure. It is taking the measurements over a large number of repitions, 10 million for measuring function and system calls, and 1 million times for process and thread switching.

Choosing which case to measure is done by inputting a number from 1-4 when prompted. Running the executable will explain the choices.
